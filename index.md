## About Me

I am a undergraduate student at [Sun Yat-Sen University(https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/)] (SYSU)[PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.01085v1.pdf), advised by Prof. [Qing Ling(http://home.ustc.edu.cn/~qingling/)]. Currently, I join [Cognitive Computing and Natural Language Center(https://idea.edu.cn/en/ccnl.html)] at [IDEA Research(https://idea.edu.cn/en/about-idea.html)] as a research intern, supervised by Dr. Jiaxing Zhang.
My research focuses on computer vision and natural language processing, especially in spatiotemporal predictive learning, meta-learning, text classification.

## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** video prediction
- **Nature Language Processing:** meta-learning, text classification

## News

- **[Jun. 2022]** The Fengshen framework is officially open source, which helps you easily pre train and fine tune the foundation models of the "Fengshenbang".
- **[May. 2022]** GTS factory uses AI to automate the production of AI models, which are now open for public testing.
- **[May. 2022]** Under my leadership, IDEA-CCNL plans to open source the **first large foundation model for extreme weather forecasting**.
- **[Apr. 2022]** The official implementation of TCTN received **50 stars** in github.
