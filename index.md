## About Me

I am a undergraduate student at Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU), advised by Prof. Qing Ling. Currently, I join Cognitive Computing and Natural Language Center at IDEA Research as a research intern, supervised by Dr. Jiaxing Zhang.
My research focuses on computer vision and natural language processing, especially in spatiotemporal predictive learning, meta-learning, text classification.

## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** video prediction
- **Nature Language Processing:** meta-learning, text classification

## News

- **[Jun. 2022]** The Fengshen framework is officially open source, which helps you easily pre train and fine tune the foundation models of the "Fengshenbang".
- **[May. 2022]** GTS factory uses AI to automate the production of AI models, which are now open for public testing.
- **[Sept. 2022]** Under my leadership, IDEA-CCNL plans to open source the first large foundation model for extreme weather forecasting.
- **[Mar. 2022]** I join IDEA-CCNL as a Research Intern.
