## About Me

I am a undergraduate student at [Sun Yat-Sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/) (SYSU) major in computer science, advised by Prof. [Qing Ling](http://home.ustc.edu.cn/~qingling/). Currently, I join [Cognitive Computing and Natural Language Center](https://idea.edu.cn/en/ccnl.html) at [IDEA Research](https://idea.edu.cn/en/about-idea.html) as a research intern, supervised by Dr. [Jiaxing Zhang](https://idea.edu.cn/en/person/zhangjiaxing.html).
My research focuses on computer vision and natural language processing, especially in spatiotemporal predictive learning, meta-learning, text classification.

## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** video prediction, precipitation nowcasting
- **Nature Language Processing:** meta-learning, text classification
